# React Tree With Storage

## Overview

Persisting changes in a tree view is one of the trickiest challenges in UI development — so I built **React Tree With Storage** to make it easier.

This is an interactive, hierarchical tree management system built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **V0**, featuring modern UI, persistence via **DexieDB**, and full keyboard accessibility.

> ⚙️ The tree view is built **from scratch** — no external libraries were used for its logic or behavior.

## Features

- 🗂 **Hierarchical Tree Structure** — Manage nested folders and items
- 🔄 **Drag-and-Drop Reordering** — Intuitive rearrangement of nodes
- 📝 **Inline Editing** — Rename items directly in the tree
- 📂 **Folder Creation** — Add folders and organize your content
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** — Automatically saves changes to **DexieDB**
- 🎨 **Modern UI** — Powered by **shadcn/ui** and **TailwindCSS**
- ♿️ **Accessibility Support** — ARIA-compliant components
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Navigation** — Navigate and edit without a mouse
